# JSTQL JavaScript Transform tool

This tool is created to transform JavaScript based on definitions written in a custom DSL called JSTQL

## JSTQL

This is a DSL created to define proposal transformations using templates. A transformation is defined by two templates, a template of what code snippets to search for **applicable to** and a template of how to transform those snippets **transform to**.

Examples of definitions for proposals can be found in [dsl_files](./dsl_files/)
